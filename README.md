# Mathematical Optimization with Gurobi
## Generalized Cash Balance Problem

This project was created in order to implement results from the paper *The generalized cash balance problem: optimization-based one step ahead optimal control* by A. Bhaya and E. Kaszkurewicz.

**Note: Some modifications still need to be implemented and the code needs to revised.**
